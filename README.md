Task 1 : Here we are supposed to observe the learning curve for all the five datasets differing in size training and testing data. We have to observe that for increasing values of hyper parameters, which is the best hyper-parameter for which we get the least train and test error. This task is implemented in part1.py
Task 2 : Here we are keeping the hyper-parameters fixed and then doing stratified cross validation and have plot and observe the learning curve produce . It is in the file part2.py
Task 3.1: Here, we will implement an algorithm to choose the best hyper-parameter,and then perform training and testing on the dataset by performing cross validation. This is in the file part3_1.py
Task 3.2 Here, we will use newton's method of updation for calculating the 4 different hyper-parameters and train and test our model using that. It is in the file part3_2.py.

The datasets i.e train and test data are already splitted for ease of convenience. 

for Task 1 ,3.1, 3.2
input format is:[file name] [train data] [train label] [test data] [test label]

for task 2

input format is :[file name]
